"System design is something that could be very variety based on different backgrounds, so what is really important is kept your minds open."

1. Comming up with a basic solution first.

   - Time is limited
   - What the interviewer focus most might be different
   - A complex design might take too much time to depict, and that occupys the time for the communication beween you and the interviewer.

2. Asking clarifying questions and stating your assumptions.

   - Shrink the scope.
   - Identify the variants and invariants.
   - Clarifying functional requirements and non-functional requirements.
   - State your assumptions.

3. Focusing on concepts and let interviewer drive.

   - Don't dive too deep into the technical details.

4. Talking about trade-offs.

   - Offering multiple trade-offs.

5. Don't memorize solutions.
